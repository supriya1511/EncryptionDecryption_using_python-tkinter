# EncryptionDecryption_using_python-tkinter
Python provides the Tkinter toolkit to develop GUI applications. Here we have to implement a message encryption-decryption application according to the Vigenere cipher, which can encrypt the message using the key and can decrypt the encrypted hash using same key.


Modules used in the project :
Tkinter  -> GUI toolkit, time datetime, base64   -> Vigenere cipher
